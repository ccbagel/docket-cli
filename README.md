Hello there. This tool is a very simple to use to-do app built for the command line. It's very easy to customize this program if need be. I've created this as a learning project and I find it useful since I can stay in the terminal and keep track of small tasks when working with a large codebase. find You can find it on Github @ github.com/ccbagel/docket-cli.

To install this program, run npm i docket-cli

1. To start, run todos docket OR you can skip the intro and use one of the commands below to start a task.

2. To create a new item in your todo list, run todos add "task".

3. To see your current tasks, run todos list.

4. To mark a task complete, run todos -t OR todos --task <tasks...>. 
NOTE: if you run todos -t OR todos --task without specifying the task you want to delete which has its index number in the list, you'll mark all your tasks done. 

If you need help, run todos --help to see the commands you can run.
Happy hacking ðŸ˜Ž
